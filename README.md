# ts-express-psql

A simple Express API with a Postgres database.

`pg` branch mostly follows https://blog.logrocket.com/crud-rest-api-node-js-express-postgresql/
SQL queries are written directly into the JavaScript code with `pgBouncer`.

`prisma` branch adds the Prisma ORM and basic error handling in the routes.
